# A Breakdown of Horiseon Accessility Challenge

## Purpose of Week 1 Challenge: Accessibility
This week's challenged aimed to increase the Horiseon website's accessibility using alt attributes. This allows for the website to reach a wider audience. This week's challenge also aimed to make the HTML and CSS files more readible for future developers. In changing the HTML file to use semantic elements and consolidating CSS based on those elements, it allows for easier reading for future developers. 

## Changes to HTML File: 
* Changed the original HTML file's non-semantic elements to semantic elements.

vs. The following image demonstrates the same part of the file but replaced with semantic elements:
